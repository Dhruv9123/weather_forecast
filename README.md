# weather_forecast
This application allows users to enter a city name and obtain real-time weather data, including a 5-day forecast.
Key Components of the Application:
1. Library Imports:
To build the application, various libraries are imported:

Tkinter: Used for designing the graphical user interface (GUI).
TimezoneFinder: Helps in determining the time zone based on geographical coordinates.
Requests: Used for making HTTP requests to various APIs.
Pytz: Manages and manipulates time zones.
PIL (Pillow): Handles image processing for displaying weather icons.
2. Function Definition: getWeather:
The getWeather function is the core of the application. It performs several critical tasks:

Retrieving City Coordinates: It fetches the city name from the user input and uses the OpenCage Geocoding API to get the city's latitude and longitude.
Determining the Time Zone: With the coordinates, the TimezoneFinder library determines the city's time zone, which is then displayed in the GUI.
Displaying Local Time: Using the datetime and pytz libraries, the local time for the city is computed and displayed. This time is updated every second.
Fetching Current Weather Data: The OpenWeatherMap API is called to get the current weather conditions, which include temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and a weather description. These details are updated in the GUI.
5-Day Weather Forecast: Another API call to OpenWeatherMap fetches the 5-day weather forecast. The function processes this data to display day and night temperatures for each of the next five days, along with corresponding weather icons.
3. GUI Setup:
The graphical user interface is meticulously designed using Tkinter:

Labels and Entry Widgets: These components are used for displaying weather information and allowing users to enter city names.
Frames and Images: They organize the layout and display weather icons in a visually appealing manner.
4. Event Loop:
The application’s event loop is initiated using Tkinter’s mainloop(), making the GUI responsive to user interactions and dynamically updating weather information.

Detailed Functionality Breakdown:
Geocoding and Time Zone Calculation:
The city name entered by the user is converted to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) using the OpenCage Geocoding API. These coordinates are then used by TimezoneFinder to ascertain the city's time zone, ensuring the local time is accurately displayed.

Weather Data Retrieval:
Real-time weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. This data includes essential weather parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and a brief weather description. Additionally, the application retrieves a detailed 5-day forecast, displaying both day and night temperatures, which are crucial for users planning ahead.

User Interface Design:
The application’s interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Input fields allow users to enter city names, while the weather data is displayed clearly using labels and images. Frames are used to organize the layout effectively, and weather icons are dynamically updated based on the retrieved forecast data.

Conclusion:
This weather application showcases the integration of multiple APIs and libraries to provide real-time, comprehensive weather data in a user-friendly interface. By leveraging Python’s robust ecosystem, the application delivers a practical and visually appealing solution for weather monitoring.
